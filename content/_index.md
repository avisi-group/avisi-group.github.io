The AVISI group is a research group based in the School of Computer Science, at the University of St Andrews that focuses on **Architecture Virtualisation and Simulation** technologies, and related concerns.

We're interested in:
* Hardware Virtualisation
* Instruction Set Simulation
* Operating Systems
* Just-in-time Compilation
* Dynamic Binary Translation

We love collaborating with other institutes - academic, or industrial!  If you're interested in working with us, please [get in touch](/contact).
